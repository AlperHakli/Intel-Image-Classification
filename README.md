# Intel-Image-Classification

## Conclusion

In this notebook, we built a convolutional neural network model and applied data augmentation techniques to improve generalization. We also visualized ROC curves for each class to evaluate the performance in detail.

ðŸ’¡ I hope this project gave you useful insights and ideas for your own machine learning tasks!
